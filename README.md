# Testing track selection

To use the testing script, run `yarn test-track-selection URL`

e.g. `yarn test-track-selection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk`

It will print out a list of all available tracks, then a list of selected tracks. 

Please see this confluence page for a list of good videos to test: https://vivi-internal.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/680853626/Video+Direct+test+collection
